# DestinyVault

Simple program built using C# & Entity Framework on the backend for API calls and database management. Then React typescript to build the front end.

Currently only local hosted using my bungie API key.

Grabs your characters inventories and your vault then allows you to sort or search for weapons by type, element, level, slot, or name.

Website end is currenlty unmade but the backend is mostly done
